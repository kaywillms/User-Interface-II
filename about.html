            <p>I am orignal from the caribbean island of Dominca where I lived for 20 years. My passion for
                technology was
                sparked at a young age from looking at my uncle repair old radios. I guess at the age of 10
                most
                of my pairs
                would much rather play sports or video games than obsessing over how a transistor worked.
                I eventually got
                into the busniess of repairing electronic applicances in my teens years for neighbors who
                were crazy enough to
                let a teenager dissect their appliance. I soon developed an interest in computer technology
                from
                this
                hubby.</p>

            <p>Twelve years ago I came to the United States with the same passion that fueled me during my
                teen
                years. I guess
                in life you know that you were born to do something if you have a burning desire that never
                subsided. My plan of action was to get into tecnology. My IT career consisted of
                working for Dell as
                a repair technician, to software and administration and then onsite network tech. I never
                devoted as much time and passion to my previous IT careers the way
                I do for Web Development. I have to two daughter who are my
                motivation for putting in the hard work and effort to not only reach, but go beyond my
                goals.
            </p>
